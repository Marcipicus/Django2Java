MIDIPlayer documentation

The MIDIPlayer is essentially a Facade around the Java MIDI library that
also uses the singleton design pattern.
(Look up the Facade and Singleton design patterns in the design patterns book or wikipedia)

This class is currently in an incomplete state. 

Feel free to modify any of the functions.

The functions that already play music use the noteOn method which sends
a message directly to the MIDI System.

The proper way of doing it is to create a sequence and then send it to
the Synthesizer/Sequencer.
