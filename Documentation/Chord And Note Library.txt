This documentation file explains the MIDINoteLibrary and ChordLibrary

Both the MIDINoteLibary and ChordLibrary use the singleton design pattern which is
basically....

You design a piece of code for which there should only be one instance(File System, Database etc)



Chord Library
I created the chordlibrary so that people would not create duplicate instances of
chords and there would be one consistent data structure for the whole program. 

This allows a programmer to detect cycles in the data structure which would basically be
a chord progression that returns to a certain chord. 

Had I allowed users of the library to create chords themselves then you run the 
risk of the programmer not creating them properly or creating duplicates.

In the future I intend to hide the implementation of the chord class completely and
replace it with an interface that the hidden chord class implements.



MIDINoteLibrary
The MIDINoteLibrary was created basically to save memory.
