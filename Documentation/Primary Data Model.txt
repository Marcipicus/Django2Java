1. Data Model
1. NoteName
The first part of the project to learn is the data model

The NoteName enumeration defines all of the notes in music without a particular octave.
You can use the NoteName methods to find related chords and scales.

2. Interval
The Interval Enumeration defines all of the intervals needed to 
define chords, scales, and notes by their relationship to the root note.

3. ChordSignature
The ChordSignature Enumeration defines all of the main chord signatures that exist
by the Intervals that the specific signature contains...e.g Major  (Root,Major3,Perfect5)

4. Scale Signature
The Scale Signature Enumeration defines all of the main ScaleSignatures that exist
by the Intervals that the specific signature contains....
e.g. Major Scale(Ionian)(Root,Major2,Major3,Perfect4,Perfect5,Major6,Major7,Perfect8)

5. MIDINote
The MIDINote class is used to convert a NoteName and a register into a byte value
that can be used to produce a sound using the Java Midi Interface

4. Chord
The Chord class represents a Chord with a Root Note and a ChordSignature.
This class can create a list of MIDI Value ChordTones with the specified RootNote and 
all of the notes in the chord signature. You must also provide a register value.
See Chord.getChordTones(int register)

5. UsefulUnicodeCharacters
The UsefulUnicodeCharacters class is just a place to store characters that you can't type
on a keyboard(flat,sharp,natural signs etc.)
