Rating Data Model

The following classes are used to rate consonance of chord changes, chord scale relationships,
and Interval Chord Relationships. These ratings are stored in files and later used to generate
chord changes and possibly melodies in the future.

1. ConsonanceRating

a specific scale/mode Signature with the same root

6. ChordChangeConsonance

and all other ChordSignatures at all intervals between the two chord's root notes.

7. EndChordRatingList
